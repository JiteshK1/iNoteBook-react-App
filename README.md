# NewsMonkey - React News Application


## Overview

NewsMonkey is a modern news aggregation application built with React.js. It provides users with the latest news from various categories and sources, all in one place. The application fetches data from a news API to display up-to-date news articles in a clean, user-friendly interface.

- **Category Filtering**: Browse news by categories such as Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports, and Technology
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific news articles by keywords
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices - desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Article Preview**: Read article summaries and click through to full articles
- **Infinite Scroll**: Load more articles as you scroll down
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback while content is loading

## Technology Stack

- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface
- **React Router**: For navigation between different sections
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components
- **News API**: External API for fetching news data
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests
- **CSS3**: For custom styling and animations

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

You'll also need:
- A News API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JiteshK1/NewsMonkey-App-React.git
   cd NewsMonkey-App-React
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your News API key:
   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## API Usage

This project uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch news articles. The free tier of News API has some limitations:

- Limited number of requests per day
- Only works in development mode (localhost)
- For production deployment, you may need to upgrade to a paid plan or use an alternative API

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various platforms:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Note: Due to News API restrictions, you may need to use a proxy server or alternative API for production deployment.
